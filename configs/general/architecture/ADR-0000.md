# Tracking Architectural Decisions

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2021-08-20

## Issue

Most of important technical decisions in this project are based on the current status of these technologies, while they are evolving rapidly every year. We may flip our decision based on these cutting-edge features.

We need a way to record important technical decisions, which allow us tracking different new technologies and quickly switching between them without rediscovering the key points preventing the switch.

## Decision

We use Architectural Decision Records (ADR) to record the context of every decision.

## Consequences

### Pros

- For every decision, we can record, update context.
- We can track and update alternative options.

### Cons

- Require more documentation work.

## Alternative Options

### Tracking options individually

We can track every option/technology individually in each document.

- Good, because we can grab more detail for individual option
- Bad, because it can be complex to maintain from the view of issue. Updating the context of a single issue may end up with updating multiple related documents.
